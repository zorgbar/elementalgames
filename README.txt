Elemental Games is a basic online store project I created for University. It is not particularly polished but does its job.

To host, install XAMPP @https://www.apachefriends.org

Copy elementalgamesDB folder into xampp\htdocs

Run XAMPP and start Apache and MySQL.

Visit localhost/elementalGamesDB via browser of choice.

Voila, elementalGames will be running and navigatable.
